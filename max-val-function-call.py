so it would be really cool to get a new job, to get more money, to get to work with the front end team
to be working with the CMS team and learn what I need to learn
To get a Degree and get good at DS Algos and then pass the interview and then get to work with a team and learn code
that would be what I want to do
Just to progress
Just write DS algo in python and then I can work on tickets and get better at coding

They hire me on the team and then teach me site core. it would be real cool to then start bug chasing etc.
