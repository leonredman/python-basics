# rich comparison methods

'''
Complete the __gt__ method. A quarterback is considered greater than another only if that quarterback has
 both more wins and a higher quarterback passer rating.

Once __gt__ is complete, compare Tom Brady's 2007 stats as well (yards: 4806, TDs: 50, completions: 398, 
attempts: 578, interceptions: 8, wins: 16).
